- Fun project because I needed more hands on with NextJS
- Had time so wanted to help friends build their personal brand (do anything valuable for their hobbiess, careers, etc.)
- Friend that does a lot of photography lacked a site and had been planning on making one sooner or later.
- Perfect! After looking for some free templates we found a near perfect one from the free Astro templates.
- Only needed cleanup pages we don't need, recreate homepage and touchup some components.
- Biggest job is to figure out how to make it easy for friend to upload pictures in high quality and write posts.
- Write Powershell scripts, teach basics about GitHub, VSCode and file structure.
- Andreas picks up things very quickly, due to being tech savvy and a gamer.
    - Did you have any coding experience before?
    - Why do you think it was easy to pickup GitHub and the new filetype for your blogs?
    - From 1-10 how difficult did you find the process of learning to update and create new blog posts?

- Props spent under 30 active hours on the project, where most hours were spent teaching and helping out Andreas.
- End result is a personalized website that brings actual value to customer.
    - Grandma from accross the world can actually see most of my work now.
